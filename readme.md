# Security Group Watcher for MS Teams/Slack
 
I work for @AWSCloud & my opinions are my own.


# Basic Intro
SAM package for creating a cloudwatch event whenever someone modifies a security group and posts into MS Teams/Slack in near real time.<br>
This is a simple example that posts the event. You might be asking isn't this the same as sending alerts to email?
Correct, however it's what you do after the event has triggered where it becomes much more powerful then email.<br>
You could add features like:

- Only alarm when certain risky ports/ranges/vpc's are entered (22,3389 to 0.0.0.0/0 etc)
- Create policyâ€™s that enforce these rules automatically, enabling teams to move faster while still having visibility into what they are doing.

# Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)
- AWS Account 
- MS Teams or Slack account with permissions to install webhooks
- One S3 bucket to store your files

# Demo

- I add a new rule in my security group to: Allow all traffic on all ports (sigh, if only people never did this)

- This triggers a cloudwatch event and MS Teams sends a notification

# Install Steps:

## Clone repo
`git clone https://github.com/MattTunny/watch-security-group.git`

## Pre Account Setup

- Make a s3 bucket for your lambda's:
`aws s3 mb s3://your-unique-bucket-name --region ap-southeast-2`


## Create MS Teams Webhook
- Log into your MS Teams account and select the channel you want to install the webhook
- Select Connectors

- Paste your webhook url into the default value in template.yaml and if you want to test locally paste it into vars.json

## Deploy App

- run sam package to s3 bucket you created earlier: 
```bash
sam package --template-file template.yaml --s3-bucket your-s3-bucket --output-template sam-output.yaml
```
- run sam deploy:
```bash
sam deploy --template-file sam-output.yaml --stack-name WatchSecurityGroup --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

## Testing App

Testing is really easy with sam-cli, you just give it the function and event you want to invoke.
> Note: you need to modify the "groupId" value in the sample events with a real security group for testing, also add a real webhook value in vars.json.

- run sam test:
```bash
sam local invoke -e events/event_iam.json WatchSecurityGroupFunction -n vars.json
```
